 *
 *  The LEDs are connected to input-outpins (I/O) RC0 through RC3. First, the I/O pin
 *  must be configured for an output. In this case, when one of these pins is driven high
 *  (RC0 =  1 ), the LED will turn on. These two logic levels are derived from the power pins
 *  of the PIC MCU. Since the PIC device?s power pin (VDD) is connected to 5V and the
 *  source (VSS) to ground (0V), a '1' is equivalent to 5V, and a '0' is 0V.
 *
 *
 *  This turns on DS1 LED on the Low Pin Count Demo Board.

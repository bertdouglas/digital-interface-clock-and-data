 *******************************************************************
 * Lesson 4 - "Analog to Digital"
 *
 * This shows how to read the A2D converter and display the
 * High order parts on the 4 bit LED display.
 * The pot on the Low Pin Count Demo board varies the voltage
 * coming in on in A0.
 *
 * The A2D is referenced to the same Vdd as the device, which
 * is nominally is 5V.  The A2D returns the ratio of the voltage
 * on Pin RA0 to 5V.  The A2D has a resolution of 10 bits, with 1023 
 * representing 5V and 0 representing 0V.
 *
 *
 * The top four MSbs of the ADC are mirrored onto the LEDs. Rotate the potentiometer
 * to change the display.
 *
 *  PIC: 16F1829
 *  Compiler: XC8 v1.00
 *  IDE: MPLABX v1.10
 *
 *  Board: PICkit 3 Low Pin Count Demo Board
 *  Date: 6.1.2012

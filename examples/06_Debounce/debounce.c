 *******************************************************************
 * Lesson 6 - "Debounce"
 *
 * This lesson uses a simple software delay routine to avoid the initial noise on the switch
 * pin. The code will delay for only 5 ms, but should overcome most of the noise. The
 * required delay amount differs with the switch being used. Some switches are worse
 * than others.

 * This lesson also introduces the  #define preprocessing symbol in both 'C' and assembly.
 * Hard coding pin locations is bad practice. Values that may be changed in the future
 * should always be defined once in preprocessing. Imagine if another user wanted to use
 * these lessons in a different PIC device and all of the pins changed! This would require
 * going into the code and finding every instance of any pin reference.

 * When the switch is held down, DS1 will be lit. When the switch is not held down, all
 * LEDs are OFF.
 *

 *  IDE: MPLABX v1.10

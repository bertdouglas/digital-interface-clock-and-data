Started work on abstraction of serial output frame timing.
Draw diagrams.  Make symbolic names for times.
Use a consistent layered approach.

Make spreadsheet to calculate dependent values.

Work on pin and signal assignments.
Draw diagrams.  Make tables of assignments.
A lot of consulting of device data sheet.

Code primitive app domain i/o functions
Code device configuration, including i/o and clocks.

Learn how to use mplab.  Create project.
Find where mplab include files are located.
/opt/microchip/xc8/...

Start compiling.
Figure out what standard include files are needed.
  xc8.h
  stdint.h
  stdbool.h
  stddef.h

Start compiling code written yesterday.
Lots of misunderstanding about how to use bitfields.
Resolve by reading the include file.  There is no xc8.h include file.
Instead it gets redirected to a file corresponding to the processor name.

Learned that LATA5 is not defined for this processor.
This is the mclr-/vpp pin.  It can be used by software for input,
but not for output.

So swap the DR and ACK signals.
Otherwise I have to use the pins reserved for external oscillator.
Rather not do that.

Now compiling, except for the references to serial frame time constants.
I am not happy defining these manually.  Would rather the process be
automated.  Can't really define them with C code, as some of the numbers
are large, but used only for documentation purposes.

Reorganize fles.
Put into git.

Write python script to generate c code for compile time definitions.
Change naming convention to all upper case.

Check if response from hilario.
